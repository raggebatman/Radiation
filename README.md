# Radiation

Radiation is a plugin that's made to stop people from
extending rounds too much.
It works by ticking away players' health, starting at a configurable time
after the Alpha Warhead has detonated.
You can choose which roles will take damage and you can choose how that
damage is applied.
View the config file for details.
